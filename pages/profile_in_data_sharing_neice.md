description: "The Federal CDO Councilâ€™s Data Sharing Working Group highlights successful data sharing activities to recognize mature data sharing practices as well as to incentivize and inspire others to take part in similar collaborations. This Profile in Data Sharing focuses on how the federal government and states support children who are being placed for adoption or foster care across state lines. It greatly reduces the work and time required for states to exchange paperwork and information needed to process the placements. Additionally, NEICE allows child welfare workers to communicate and provide timely updates to courts, relevant private service providers, and families."

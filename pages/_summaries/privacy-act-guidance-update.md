resource_name: OMB Memorandum for the Senior Agency Officials for Information
  Resources Management, Privacy Act Guidance â€” Update
description: >-
  This memorandum calls attention to three areas and suggests specific remedial
  steps for agencies: (1) Agencies' disclosures of personal information from
  systems of records during the course of litigation; (2) the disclosure of
  personal information from Privacy Act files, which allows agencies to make

  non-consensual disclosures if the disclosure would be "required" under the Freedom of Information Act; (3) the relationship between the exemption provisions of the Privacy Act and those of the Freedom of Information Act. Dated May 24, 1985.
